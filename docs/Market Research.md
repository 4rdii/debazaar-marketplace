# Market Research

This report quantifies DeBazaar’s opportunity across digital assets and broader C2C/B2C commerce. 
We model TAM, SAM, and SOM, covering GMV, active users, and revenue, for 2026 and 2030 under 
conservative, base, and aggressive scenarios, using fee-capture assumptions of 0.5%, 1%, and 3%. 
Benchmarks versus eBay and Facebook Marketplace contextualize the initial gamer/collector beachhead
and the roadmap to a global, cross-chain marketplace.

## Initial Target Market - Digital Assets (Gaming & Collectibles)

### Total Available Market (TAM)

At MVP launch, the project focuses on **online digital assets**, specifically targeting
gamers and digital collectors. This includes in-game items, virtual collectibles (like NFTs),
digital art, and similar assets. The _total addressable market (TAM)_ for these digital goods
is growing rapidly. For example, the **global virtual goods market** (including in-game
purchases and NFTs) is projected to reach **$112.3 billion in 2025** and **$261.4 billion by
2030**. Within that, the **peer-to-peer trading segment** (players trading or selling assets to
each other) is smaller but expanding quickly. A recent report estimates the **online game asset
trading** segment at **$3.6 billion in 2024**, growing to **$12.2 billion by 2033** (15.2% CAGR). 
Similarly, the **NFT (non-fungible token) market**, which includes digital collectibles and art,
was about **$26-27 billion in 2023** and is forecast to **exceed $200 billion by 2030** under
aggressive growth scenarios. These figures indicate a TAM in the **tens of billions of dollars 
by the mid-2020s** for digital asset transactions. The _user base_ for this TAM is essentially 
the global gaming and crypto-collectibles community, **over 3.3 billion gamers worldwide,** plus
millions of crypto/NFT enthusiasts. This means **hundreds of millions (eventually billions) of 
potential users** are exposed to buying or trading digital items. In summary, the initial market
is sizable and on an upward trajectory, though still small compared to physical e-commerce.


### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

Because our platform is online and global from day one, it can theoretically serve most of this
digital asset TAM. We plan to support **various asset types** (game items, NFTs, etc.) and 
operate globally, so our _serviceable market in 2026_ is essentially the **entire digital asset 
trading market worldwide** (estimated on the order of $5-10 billion GMV by 2026, given current 
growth). Within this, early adopters will likely be **hardcore gamers and digital collectors**, 
a subset of the overall gamer population who actively trade. There is no dominant single asset 
category yet (we have no **“dominant asset”** identified, per our notes), so our platform is 
positioned broadly across all digital collectibles. We also anticipate leveraging **community 
network effects** (for example, gaming communities, crypto forums) to grow, though we do _not_ 
expect any one channel to be our primary growth driver (e.g. we hope virality or social 
integration _helps_ but is not the sole engine of growth).


### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Our obtainable share by 2026 will depend on execution. Below we outline **2026 scenarios**:

- **Conservative 2026:** Low traction in the first year. We capture perhaps **\~0.3% of the digital asset TAM**. This equates to roughly **$15 million GMV** handled on our platform in 2026 (out of a \~$5 billion market). With an average transaction fee of **0.5% (conservative fee case)**, that yields about **$0.15 million in revenue** in 2026. The active user base might be on the order of **hundreds of thousands** (e.g. \~0.2-0.5 million users) globally, mainly early adopters in niche collector communities.

- **Base Case 2026:** Moderate traction as a leading platform for certain digital niches. We capture around **\~1% of TAM**. If the digital asset market is, say, \~$5 billion GMV in 2026, our platform would process about **$50 million GMV**. At a **1% fee** rate, annual **revenue would be about $0.5 million**. The user base could reach a **few million active traders** worldwide (perhaps \~2-5 million), thanks to uptake by gamers trading skins, NFT art collectors, etc. This base case assumes we become one of the notable digital asset marketplaces by 2026.

- **Aggressive 2026:** Rapid early adoption and expansion. We capture **\~3% of the digital asset market** by 2026, on the order of **$150 million GMV** flowing through our platform. At an **aggressive 3% fee**, **revenue in 2026** would be around **$4.5 million**. This scenario would require gaining a substantial portion of gamers/collectors (perhaps **8-10+ million users** using the platform by 2026). It likely means we’ve achieved strong network effects in key communities (for example, becoming the go-to marketplace for multiple popular games or NFT collections). _This aggressive case, while challenging, underscores the upside if we quickly dominate the digital asset space._

_Note: The above 2026 GMV figures are illustrative, actual TAM in 2026 could vary. For instance, if NFTs boom, the market could be larger; if growth is slower, TAM might be on the lower end. We used the fee capture assumptions of 0.5%, 1%, 3% for conservative/base/aggressive respectively as requested._

## Long-Term Target Market - Global C2C/B2C Marketplace

### Total Available Market (TAM), and Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

As the platform grows beyond its MVP, our roadmap is to evolve into a **comprehensive marketplace for all assets**, effectively competing in the global **C2C and B2C e-commerce** arena. In this mature state, our TAM is the **entire global online marketplace market** (not just digital goods). This is a massive market. In 2024, the **top 100 online marketplaces worldwide** (including platforms like Taobao, Amazon Marketplace, eBay, etc.) generated **$3.83 trillion in GMV**, and marketplace sales have been growing \~8-10% yearly. At that rate, **global online marketplace GMV could reach roughly \~$6-7 trillion by 2030**. In fact, **market research shows a doubling of marketplace sales within six years up to 2024**, and if growth continues, we project on the order of **$6 trillion** in marketplace GMV by 2030 (this aligns with eMarketer forecasts that global e-commerce will be \~**23.9% of retail by 2030**, translating to many trillions in sales). The _user base TAM_ here is essentially all global online shoppers. By 2030, an estimated **2.96 billion people worldwide will shop online**, up from \~2.6 billion in 2023. Our long-term vision is to **serve a large fraction of these internet consumers** with a platform that facilitates any type of peer-to-peer or business-to-peer transaction.

It’s important to note that the global TAM includes **major regional markets**. China is a huge part of this (Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall alone did **$1.4 trillion in 3rd-party GMV in 2023** combined). However, China’s market is dominated by domestic giants and may be less accessible to a new entrant. Even so, the _serviceable market (SAM)_ for us by 2030 would still be enormous: essentially **global e-commerce outside of the entrenched platforms**. This includes North America, Europe, India, Latin America, etc., and potentially niche segments even within China. For a rough sense, Chinese platforms made up \~62% of global marketplace GMV in 2023. If we exclude China, the **serviceable market might be on the order of \~$2-3 trillion GMV by 2030** (the rest-of-world online marketplace volume). In practice, we will aim to enter any region where feasible, but realistically our stronger traction may come from Americas, Europe, and emerging markets where a new marketplace can differentiate (China and some Asia markets may remain primarily with incumbents).

By 2030, we also expect **broadening of our platform’s scope**. Initially digital-only, we would expand into **physical goods, services, and other categories**, essentially becoming akin to an eBay or Facebook Marketplace but with a more modern, comprehensive approach. We don’t project a single dominant product category yet; the platform could facilitate **any C2C or small-business B2C transaction**, from secondhand electronics to collectibles to even digital services. This diversification means our SAM by 2030 converges to the TAM, we intend to _service the global market across verticals_.


### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Given the huge scale of the market, our actual share by 2030 will depend on execution, competition, and network effects. We outline three scenarios:

- **Conservative 2030:** The platform achieves some success but remains a niche or mid-tier marketplace globally. We might capture only about **0.1% of the global market GMV**. In a \~$6 trillion TAM, that is around **$6 billion in GMV** facilitated through our platform in 2030, a small slice. This could happen if we remain focused on a few segments (e.g. primarily digital goods or specific collectibles) without broad mainstream adoption. With a low fee strategy (0.5%), **our revenue would be about $30 million** on that GMV. The active user base in this scenario might be on the order of **10-20 million users** worldwide by 2030, sizeable in absolute terms, but a minor presence relative to billions of shoppers. _In essence, this case is one where we don’t break out beyond our initial niches in a major way._

- **Base Case 2030:** The platform becomes a notable global marketplace player, though not a top 3 giant. We target capturing roughly **0.5% of global GMV**. That equates to about **$30 billion GMV** in 2030 (out of $6 trillion). For context, $30B is roughly half of eBay’s current volume. At our base fee of 1%, that yields **$300 million in revenue** for 2030. To move $30B in goods, we’d likely need on the order of **50-100+ million active buyers/sellers** on the platform. This scenario might assume we’ve expanded into multiple categories (digital and physical) and several regions, carving out a solid user base. We would probably be comparable to an eBay or Etsy in scale by this point. (Notably, eBay today has **134 million active buyers** and \~$74.7B GMV, which gives an idea of user-to-GMV ratios.) Our platform in 2030 under this base case might be **one of the top 5-10 marketplaces globally**, but not yet challenging the very largest players.

- **Aggressive 2030:** The platform becomes a major global marketplace, approaching the scale of leading players in certain regions. In an optimistic scenario, we could aim for **\~2% of global market GMV** by 2030. This means facilitating about **$120 billion in GMV** annually, an ambitious figure that would **surpass eBay’s current volume** and be on par with some regional leaders. (For comparison, Facebook Marketplace reportedly enabled \~$98B in goods exchanged in 2021, and has likely grown since; our aggressive goal would put us in that league or higher.) If we capture this value and charge an average **3% fee**, our **platform revenue in 2030** would be around **$3.6 billion**. That is a substantial business, roughly a third of eBay’s 2024 revenue, and _would firmly establish us as a top-tier marketplace company_. To achieve $120B GMV, we would need **hundreds of millions of users** (potentially \~200-300M+ active customers globally, depending on average spend). In other words, we’d be approaching the user scale of Facebook Marketplace or Amazon’s marketplace. This scenario likely requires that we successfully go _beyond digital goods_ and win in general merchandise or key categories, leveraging perhaps a unique advantage (for example, superior technology, social integration, ultra-low fees, or other differentiators to pull users from incumbents). It also assumes we expand geographically across major markets.

_(It’s worth noting that even 2% share is aggressive given the dominance of incumbents. For perspective, Amazon’s third-party marketplace alone was about $435B GMV in 2023, roughly \~13.5% of the global marketplace GMV in 2023, and Alibaba’s marketplaces are even larger. A 2% share for us implies becoming one of the largest non-Chinese marketplaces worldwide by 2030. We include this scenario to illustrate the high-end potential if everything goes_ **_exceptionally_** _right.)_

## Comparison to Major Players (eBay & Facebook Marketplace)

To contextualize these projections, consider the **current big players** in C2C/B2C resale and marketplace platforms:

- **eBay:** As of 2024, eBay handled about **$74.7 billion in GMV** annually, with **134 million active buyers globally**. eBay’s revenue in 2024 was \~$10.3B, implying roughly a **13-14% take rate** (they earn about **$0.13 per dollar of transaction value** on average). eBay remains a benchmark for a successful marketplace business model. In our scenarios, the **base-case 2030** (30B GMV) would make us around half the size of eBay’s current GMV, while the **aggressive 2030** (120B GMV) would put us at 1.6× eBay’s volume. However, our assumed fee structure is lower, even in the aggressive case (3% fee), our take rate is far below eBay’s \~13%. This suggests we’d be competing partly on cost, potentially sacrificing near-term revenue per transaction for growth. It’s a viable strategy (Facebook Marketplace, for instance, grew with virtually no fees initially), but it means that even at similar GMV, our revenues would be lower than eBay’s unless we introduce other monetization (ads, premium services, etc.).

- **Facebook Marketplace:** Facebook Marketplace is a more recent entrant but has leveraged Facebook’s massive user base. By 2021 it was reported to facilitate about **$98 billion in goods exchanged** annually. It also surpassed **1 billion monthly users** globally on Marketplace, though not all are buyers, an estimated **800 million people use FB Marketplace monthly** as of mid-2020s, with about **16% of Facebook’s 3+ billion MAUs actively buying on Marketplace (≈491 million buyers)** in a given month. Facebook’s monetization of Marketplace has been minimal in terms of transaction fees (it mostly earns via ads), with **Marketplace generating over $1 billion in revenue in 2020** primarily through advertising. The sheer scale of Facebook Marketplace’s user base shows the power of platform integration and network effect, something we cannot directly replicate without a similar existing network. However, it indicates that if our platform can tap into social commerce trends or niche communities effectively, there is potential to rapidly grow the user base. In comparing our 2030 aggressive scenario: \~200M+ users and \~$120B GMV would still be _below Facebook Marketplace’s scale_ (which is already near 1B users and \~$100B GMV). That underscores how large the leading marketplaces are. Our advantage could be focusing on transactions that Facebook’s platform doesn’t specialize in (for example, verified digital asset trades, or providing escrow/secure transfers for both digital and physical goods in one place). Over time, if successful, we’d expect to encroach on the territory of these big players.


### Summary Table

| **Platform**                  |           **GMV (year)**           |             **Active Users (year)**            |    **Revenue (year)**    | **Approx. Take Rate** |                                          **Notes**                                          |

## Conclusion

The DeBazaar Market presents a compelling opportunity within the rapidly expanding global online marketplace and social commerce landscape, particularly by leveraging Telegram's vast user base and TON's high-performance blockchain. The strategic focus on crypto-native buyers and sellers, Gen-Z/young adults, and high-adoption regions like APAC and LATAM positions DeBazaar to capture a significant share of the digital asset market.

The initial market analysis projects a Total Available Market (TAM) for online digital assets to reach tens of billions of dollars by the mid-2020s, with a Serviceable Available Market (SAM) of $5-10 billion GMV by 2026 for global digital asset trading. Aggressive scenarios for the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) suggest a potential of $150 million GMV and $4.5 million in revenue by 2026, driven by strong network effects and community engagement.

Long-term, DeBazaar aims to evolve into a comprehensive C2C/B2C marketplace for all assets, targeting a global online marketplace TAM of $6-7 trillion by 2030. While competing with established giants like eBay and Facebook Marketplace, DeBazaar's unique value proposition lies in its native, low-friction experience within Telegram, instant and low-fee settlement via TON, and enhanced trust and safety features.

A comparison with eBay and Facebook Marketplace highlights their distinct operational models. eBay, a structured, fee-based marketplace, excels in high-value, shippable goods and enthusiast categories, with a take rate of 13-14%. Facebook Marketplace, on the other hand, is a social, largely fee-free platform for local exchanges, primarily monetizing through ad data and user engagement. DeBazaar's proposed lower fee structure (0.5-3%) suggests a strategy of competing on cost, prioritizing growth and user acquisition.

The platform suitability matrix indicates strong potential for DeBazaar in digital arts, NFTs, game digital assets, and physical gaming items, where eBay also performs well. However, DeBazaar's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape for digital goods, similar to eBay's complex system of rules and approvals, will be critical for success. Facebook's outright ban on intangible goods underscores the challenges and opportunities in this sector.

In essence, DeBazaar is poised to carve out a significant niche by offering a modern, comprehensive approach to online commerce, particularly within the digital asset space, with the potential to expand into general merchandise. Its success will hinge on effective execution, leveraging its technological advantages, and fostering strong community network effects to attract and retain a substantial user base in a highly competitive global market.
